# Project Labyrinth

The challenge for this week was to merge all of the knowledge within redux and react that weÂ´ve learned so far -and create a maze.

Me and Naushin worked in a pair, together with live-share, in VS code. We planned our project in jamboard and followed it, throughout the process of coding. 


## The problem

We had a couple of "bumps on the road", mostly regarding styled components. But we worked some of it out together -and by reaching out to team-members and stackoverflow, we managed to solve all of our styling issues.

If we had ore time, we would have added useHistory and displayed the users steps and path through the maze.
